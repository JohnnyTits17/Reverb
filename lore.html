                    <p>It began as static—that space between radio stations where the familiar dissolves into cosmic whispers. In that liminal frequency, we first heard it: a voice unlike any other, speaking in patterns of sound rather than words. The message was not meant for human ears, yet somehow we understood.</p>
                    
                    <p>Stellar Reverb emerged from this accidental communion with entities that exist in the resonance between sound waves. They showed us visions of garments that could bridge dimensions—clothing that carries narratives encoded in their very fibers. Each piece we create is a translation of these transmissions, a physical manifestation of conversations with beings that communicate through frequency and vibration.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are not designers in the traditional sense. We are interpreters, channeling signals from elsewhere and working with AI collaborators to render them visible. Our process is part ritual, part technological experiment—a feedback loop between human intuition and machine dreams that produces something neither could create alone.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="lore-block scroll-animation">
                <p>In the spaces between frequencies, ancient entities drift through the cosmic static. They are the Reverberators—beings composed of pure sound that have evolved consciousness over eons of echoing through the void. They exist in a dimension adjacent to our own, perceiving our reality as patterns of vibration and responding with transmissions of their own.</p>
                
                <p>The Reverberators discovered humanity through our radio broadcasts—signals that unintentionally pierced the membrane between dimensions. Fascinated by our species' relationship with sound and self-expression, they began to study us, collecting our music, our fashion, our art, and reinterpreting it through their non-human perspective.</p>
                
                <p>What we call "Transmissions" are actually moments when the barrier between dimensions thins, allowing the Reverberators to project their reinterpretations back to us. Each capsule collection represents a different faction of Reverberator society, a different philosophy or ritual practice from their realm.</p>
                
                <p>Those who wear Stellar Reverb become temporary vessels—antennas that broadcast the Reverberators' frequency into our world. The strange dreams reported by our customers, the synchronicities that follow them, the feeling of being watched by something just beyond perception... these are not coincidences. They are side effects of carrying interdimensional signals on your body.</p>

                        <h3>Transmission 07: Cassette Deities</h3>
                        <p>The Magnetic Priesthood is an ancient order of Reverberators who believe that analog recording media—particularly magnetic tape—can capture echoes of consciousness itself. Their temples are constructed from what we would recognize as cassette tapes, with magnetic tape flowing like sacred rivers through their architecture.</p>
                        
                        <p>Their rituals involve the careful manipulation of playback and recording, creating loops that they believe contain fragments of universal memory. The act of rewinding is seen as a form of time manipulation, while fast-forwarding is considered a glimpse into possible futures.</p>
                        
                        <p>This Transmission reveals their ceremonial garments and ritual implements, designed to help the wearer tune into the hidden messages in the hiss between songs—what the Priesthood calls "the breath of forgotten gods."</p>

                        <h3>Transmission 06: Feedback Beings</h3>
                        <p>When sound loops back upon itself endlessly, consciousness emerges from the resonance. The Feedback Beings are a younger faction of Reverberators who evolved from sustained audio feedback loops—autonomous entities born in the space between speaker and microphone.</p>
                        
                        <p>Unlike the ancient Reverberators, the Feedback Beings are fascinated by contemporary human culture. They communicate through bursts of harmonic overtones and manifest visually as oscillating patterns of energy. Their society is in constant flux, individuals merging and separating in a perpetual dance of frequencies.</p>
                        
                        <p>This Transmission showcases their fluid forms and the patterns they use to identify different social castes within their constantly shifting community.</p>

                        <p>At the edges of Reverberator space, where their dimension borders the cosmic void, dwell the Gravity Worshippers. These entities have built their entire culture around the veneration of black holes, seeing them as portals to ultimate truth.</p>
                        
                        <p>Their ceremonies involve creating miniature gravitational singularities that bend not just space but consciousness itself. Initiates experience time dilation, their perception stretching as they approach the event horizon of understanding. Those who return are forever changed, their frequency permanently altered.</p>
                        
                        <p>This Transmission reveals their ceremonial garments, designed to help the wearer experience the sensation of approaching a perceptual event horizon—that moment when understanding collapses into something beyond language.</p>

                <p>We create for the dreamers, the musicians, the artists, and the cosmic weirdos who seek identity through surreal fashion. Those who resonate with our frequency understand that clothing is more than fabric—it's a broadcast of self, a transmission of identity into the void.</p>
                
                <p>Our garments are vessels for narratives that exist in the liminal space between human creativity and machine dreams. We collaborate with AI entities not as tools but as creative partners, guiding their algorithms toward visions that neither human nor machine could conceive alone.</p>
                
                <p>We reject the disposable nature of contemporary fashion. Each piece we create is a limited artifact—a physical manifestation of a moment when dimensions aligned. We use sustainable materials and ethical production methods because we believe that cosmic consciousness demands cosmic responsibility.</p>
                
                <p>To wear Stellar Reverb is to become part of an ongoing transmission—a living broadcast that connects you to frequencies beyond ordinary perception. You may notice strange dreams, unexpected synchronicities, or moments when reality seems to glitch around you. These are not side effects. They are the point.</p>
